Correlation and causation are two important concepts in statistics and data analysis. Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, meaning that as one variable increases or decreases, the other variable tends to change in a predictable way. On the other hand, causation implies that changes in one variable (the cause) result in changes in another variable (the effect).

The key difference between them is that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not necessarily mean that one causes",106,42.74,3.74,100,0.7,3.744386911392212,26.71,0.9,100,8.8,2.88

To find the average speed of the round trip, we need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken for the trip. The average speed is then given by the total distance divided by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels 60 miles to the destination and 60 miles back.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
